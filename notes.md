Would creating an interface for the two different states (focused vs break) be an good way of handling the timing?
-> each state has a set amount of time
-> the progress bar should fill up differently depending on the set time

How many states are there? _-> Should these different states be handled as different models or types?_
(1) focused
(2) short break
(3) long break

Should break time always be a fifth of the the focused time?

what about long breaks after every four pomos?

computer notification triggered by end of timer instead of quitting the program?

user input at least for length of pomodoros
